# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project implements a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. The system uses various machine learning techniques to identify potentially fraudulent credit card transactions based on transaction data.

## Project Structure

- `AIML Dataset.csv` - The dataset containing credit card transaction data
- `fraud_detection.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook containing the main fraud detection analysis and model
- `model.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook with model development and evaluation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you need:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, etc.)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the project files
2. Install the required Python packages
3. Open the Jupyter notebooks using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

## Usage

1. Start with `fraud_detection.ipynb` for the main analysis and data preprocessing
2. Use `model.ipynb` to explore the model development and evaluation

## Dataset

## Dataset
Download dataset from [Kaggle - Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amanalisiddiqui/fraud-detection-dataset)
Place it in the project directory before running the notebook.
